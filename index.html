                I moved from Chicago to Austin three years ago because of work. 
                I enjoy the hot weather in Texas. Without snow, make my life much easier. 
                When I have free time, I like to cook and take care of my flowers. 
                I am an software engineer and focusing on system test now. 
                Solving technical problem and reading/analyze error messages are my daily jobs.
                However, I want some change in my life. I don’t want to find/point out problem everyday. 
                I want to create something.
